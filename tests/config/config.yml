scopes:
  # list of scopes that applications can subscribe to
  - private
  - testing
  # there are 2 other scopes that are always available: 'public' & 'root'
  # - public is equivalent to access data without access_token, so there's not point
  #   in applications requesting that scope
  # - root is for functionality that must exist for the root application, but not
  #   necessarily for other applications (like creating an application or a user)
